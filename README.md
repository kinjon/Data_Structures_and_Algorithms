# README

**The repository is used for myself to study data structures and
algorithms. The reason for writing this file in English is because
my English is too weak, I want to train myself.**

## Overview    
In the repository, I plan to divide into two parts, one part is
data structures, and other part is algorithms.    
## Data Structures
This part is a description and implementation of common data structures.    
## Algorithms
This part is a description and implementation of common algorithms.
